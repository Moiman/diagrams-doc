Diagrams 1.3
============

Diagrams 1.3 was released a week ago, and by now I think we have most
of the little kinks ironed out.  This is an exciting release that
represents a great deal of effort from a lot of people. (XXX link to
list @ end).  Here's a quick rundown of some of the new features.

XXX link to migration guide

Path intersection
=================

Affine maps and projections
===========================

Grouping for transparency
=========================

Better command-line looping
===========================

Backends
========

XXX -postscript, -svg, -cairo, -gtk, -rasterific from before
Now we also have diagrams-canvas, diagrams-html5, diagrams-pgf.

Generalized numerics
====================

It used to be that diagrams were hard-coded to use ``Double``.  As of
version 1.3, ``Double`` is no longer baked in: diagrams are now
parameterized by a suitable numeric type.  It's too early to tell what
the full implications of this will be, but in theory it opens up
opportunities for things like automatic differentiation and use of
diagrams in conjunction with deeply embedded DSLs.

This feature in particular was a tough nut to crack and is the fruit
of a lot of labor.  I want to especially highlight the work of `Jan
Bracker`_, Allan Gardner, and Frank Staals, all of whom did a lot of
work attempting to generalize diagrams in this way.  Although their
code ultimately did not get merged, we learned a lot from their
attempts!  The honor of writing the code that did get merged goes to
Chris Chalmers; a big factor in his success was to simultaneously
replace the `vector-space`:pkg: package with `linear`:pkg:, which
turns out to work very nicely with diagrams and with generalized
numeric types in particular.

And lots more
=============

Of course, there are lots of other miscellaneous improvements, added
type class instances, new lenses and prisms, bug fixes, and the like.
