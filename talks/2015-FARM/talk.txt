3 mins: intro/framing/context

  - Embedded DSL in Haskell for vector graphics
  - working on it for 7+ years
  - active community
  - goals:
    - powerful.
    - Viable alternative to things like TikZ, inkscape/illustrator
  - EDSL enables artistic process.  Art influenced by tools.  How do
    tools we develop influence what we can make?
  - link to website, cabal install instructions

12 mins: explore tree visualizations?

  - Show a bunch of visualizations (radial, symmetric, boxes, etc.)

  - box layout (beside, envelope)
  - binary layout
  - Dyck paths (vectors, arrows, etc.)

5 mins: more examples
  - rotating tree (animation, etc.)y
