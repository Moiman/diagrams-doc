* GHC 7.6
** diagrams-builder

   => hint

   Latest hint requires unix <2.6 so doesn't build with GHC 7.6.
   Bumping upper bound manually then reveals that

   ghc-mtl

   also doesn't build under 7.6, but for more involved reasons
   (i.e. the GHC API changed).  So who knows what will happen with that.
** core, lib, contrib?

   All seem OK.

** cairo

   glib-0.12.3.1 doesn't build under GHC 7.6 because of this error:

   
System/Glib/GObject.chs:130:1:
    Unacceptable result type in foreign declaration:
      IO (FunPtr (Ptr () -> IO ()))
    When checking declaration:
      foreign import ccall safe "wrapper" mkDestroyNotifyPtr
        :: IO () -> IO DestroyNotify
