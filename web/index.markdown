title: About diagrams
---

Diagrams is a powerful, flexible, declarative domain-specific language
for creating vector graphics, using the
[Haskell programming language](http://haskell.org/).

Try it out!
-----------

You can:

* [Try diagrams in your browser](http://paste.hskll.org/)!

* Or, to install it locally, get the
  [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), then
  issue the command:

    <div style="text-align: center">
    `cabal install diagrams`
    </div>

    More detailed installation instructions [can be found on the diagrams wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Diagrams/Install).

Next, read the [quick start tutorial](/doc/quickstart.html) and the
[user manual](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html),
or check out the [gallery](/gallery.html) to see example images and
code.  Drop by the [`#diagrams` IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/)
with questions or post them to the
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/diagrams-discuss).

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

Diagrams is:

* *Declarative*: you specify *what* a diagram is, not *how* to draw it.

* *Compositional*: diagrams can be easily combined in many ways to produce
   more complex diagrams.

* *Embedded*: the full power of Haskell, including every library on
   [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org), is available to help construct and manipulate graphics.

* *Extensible*: extending diagrams with additional or higher-level
   functionality is as simple as writing a Haskell module.

* *Flexible*: diagrams is designed from the ground up to be as generic
   and flexible as possible.
