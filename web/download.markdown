Installing
----------

If you already have the
[Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), getting
diagrams should be as simple as

    cabal install diagrams

Otherwise, see the [quick start tutorial](/doc/quickstart.html) and
[the wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Diagrams/Install) for
more detailed instructions.

Getting the sources
-------------------

`diagrams` is an open-source project, and contributions are
encouraged!  All diagrams-related repositories are in the
[diagrams organization](http://github.com/diagrams) on github.  The
[Contributing page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Diagrams/Contributing)
on the diagrams wiki explains how to get the repositories and make
contributions.
