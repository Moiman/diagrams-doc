** TODO update release page on website
      - See previous versions for format.  Should be possible to
        essentially paste in the relevant parts of the CHANGES files
        for individual repos.
    - We should probably come up with a better format and/or a more
      automated way of doing this...
** TODO diagrams-haddock [0/2]
+ [ ] make sure all diagrams-haddock examples build
+ [ ] rebuild all diagrams-haddock examples and check them in
** TODO upload packages [0/4]
+ [ ] List release date in each CHANGES file
+ [ ] Apply a tag to each repo just before releasing
  - The tag should have a name like "vX.X.X", with a v prefixed
    to the version
  - The tag message should mention the version and give a very
    short comment describing the release
  - Use a command like: git tag -a v1.3 -m "1.3 release (update for frozz-wizz)"
+ [ ] If necessary, rename old 'release' branch to 'release-X.Y' and
  change 'release' branch to point to appropriate commit (requires a
  force-push)
+ [ ] Upload
** TODO regenerate combined Haddock documentation and commit to website.
      NOTE: this must be done AFTER releasing packages to Hackage!
      There is a script, build-haddocks.sh, in the diagrams-doc root
      which can be used to build combined Haddocks.  See the comments
      for more info and prerequisites.
** TODO Rebuild and upload new website.
