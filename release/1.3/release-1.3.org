** TODO user manual / tutorials [1/3]
+ [X] make sure all examples build
+ [ ] make sure documentation is up-to-date
+ [ ] make sure all new features are described/mentioned in the manual
** TODO testing [2/3]
+ [ ] check all travis tests
  - all tests are passing, except:
  - [ ] diagrams-doc (hakyll) (this one doesn't matter much)
  - [ ] diagrams-builder on 7.8.1 (gcc bug?)
  - [ ] diagrams-haddock on 7.8.1 (gcc bug?)
+ [X] run diagrams-backend-tests
+ [X] copy diagrams-backend-tests output to website
** TODO update release page on website
      - See previous versions for format.  Should be possible to
        essentially paste in the relevant parts of the CHANGES files
        for individual repos.
** TODO diagrams-haddock [0/2]
+ [ ] make sure all diagrams-haddock examples build
+ [ ] rebuild all diagrams-haddock examples and check them in
** TODO upload packages [1/27]
For each package:
+ [ ] List release date in each CHANGES file
+ [ ] Apply a tag to each repo just before releasing
        - The tag should have a name like "vX.X.X", with a v prefixed
          to the version
        - The tag message should mention the version and give a very
          short comment describing the release
        - Use a command like: git tag -a v1.3 -m "1.3 release (update for frozz-wizz)"

      which can be used to build combined Haddocks.  See the comments
      for more info and prerequisites.
** TODO Rebuild and upload new website.
