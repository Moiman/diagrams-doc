I am pleased to announce the release of version 0.5 of diagrams [1], a
full-featured framework and embedded domain-specific language for
declarative drawing. Check out the gallery [2] for examples of what it
can do!

Highlights of this release include:

-   A new diagrams-contrib [3] package of user-contributed modules,
    which so far contains code for tree drawing, Apollonian gaskets,
    planar tilings, "wrapped" layout, and turtle graphics.

-   Experimental support for animation, built on top of the new active
    [4] library.

-   Numerous small additions and improvements, including more general
    rounded rectangle shapes and better text support.

-   Much better performance in some common situations, such as laying
    out a very long list of diagrams using 'cat' and related
    combinators.

-   Tested with GHC 6.12, 7.0. 7.2, and 7.4.

See the release notes [5] for complete details, and the diagrams wiki
[6] for help migrating from 0.4 to 0.5 (changes should be minimal).

Try it out
----------

For the truly impatient:

    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
    cabal install diagrams

Diagrams is fully supported under GHC 6.12, 7.0, 7.2, and 7.4. However,
getting cairo to build can be tricky on some platforms; see the diagrams
wiki [7] for more information and workarounds regarding specific
platforms. (A new native SVG backend is in the works, targeted for the
0.6 release.)

To get started with diagrams, read the quick tutorial [8], which will
introduce you to the fundamentals of the framework.

For those who are even less impatient but want to really dig in and use
the power features, read the user manual [9].

Get involved
------------

Subscribe to the project mailing list [10], and/or come hang out in the
#diagrams IRC channel on freenode.org for help and discussion. Make some
diagrams. Fix some bugs [11]. Submit your cool examples for inclusion in
the gallery [2] or your cool code for inclusion in the diagrams-contrib
[3] package!

Happy diagramming!
