  + [X] user manual / tutorials
    + [X] make sure all examples build
    + [X] make sure documentation is up-to-date
    + [X] make sure all new features are described/mentioned in the manual
  + [-] testing
    + [ ] check all travis tests
      - all tests are passing, except:
      - [ ] diagrams-contrib (arithmoi)
      - [ ] diagrams-doc (hakyll)
    + [X] run diagrams-backend-tests
    + [X] copy diagrams-backend-tests output to website
  + [ ] update release page on website
    - See previous versions for format.  Should be possible to
      essentially paste in the relevant parts of the CHANGES files
      for individual repos.
    - We should probably come up with a better format and/or a more
      automated way of doing this...
  + [ ] upload packages
    + [ ] List release date in each CHANGES file
    + [ ] Apply a tag to each repo just before releasing
      - The tag should have a name like "vX.X.X", with a v prefixed
        to the version
      - The tag message should mention the version and give a very
        short comment describing the release
      - Use a command like: git tag -a v1.3 -m "1.3 release (update for frozz-wizz)"
    + [ ] Upload
  + [ ] regenerate combined Haddock documentation and commit to website.
    NOTE: this must be done AFTER releasing packages to Hackage!
    There is a script, build-haddocks.sh, in the diagrams-doc root
    which can be used to build combined Haddocks.  See the comments
    for more info and prerequisites.
  + [ ] Rebuild and upload new website.
